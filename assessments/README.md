## 9. Common Questions

### Q: Can teams change their project track after M1?
A: Yes, until M2 submission with instructor approval. After M2, track changes are not allowed.

### Q: What if a team member doesn't contribute?
A: Document contribution issues early. Contact instructor by Week 6. Individual grades can be adjusted based on documented evidence.

### Q: Can we use AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT)?
A: Yes, but you must understand all generated code and be able to explain it. You're responsible for all code security and correctness.

### Q: What if our deployed contracts have a bug?
A: Document known issues in your whitepaper. Minor bugs are acceptable if documented and understood. Critical security bugs will impact grade.

### Q: Can we build on existing open-source projects?
A: Yes, with proper attribution. You must add significant original functionality. Copying without attribution is plagiarism.

### Q: What happens if live demo fails during presentation?
A: Have a backup demo video ready. You can use the video if live demo encounters technical issues. Practice beforehand to minimize risk.

### Q: How are quizzes administered?
A: Online via Moodle, 30 minutes, closed book. Must be taken during scheduled time window. No retakes except documented emergencies.

### Q: Is mainnet deployment required?
A: No. Testnet deployment only. Do NOT deploy to mainnet without professional audit. This is a prototype/learning project.
